The dataset used for the ICASSP paper has some problems.
Some of the samples are the same (duplicates).
I removed those duplicates and losed ~15 samples.
Shouldn't have problem on the ICASSP results.

For each sample I counted the number of dots in the transcript, then divide them with the corresponding word-count.
CU-D:
0.04843509926053584 0.039409036325529896
CU-S:
0.04137165905220006 0.03545278297514985

They are significantly different (p = 0.0028, small effect) in 2 sample t-test.
Pause info should be a potential feature to classify between CU-S and CU-D.

Take the pause feature into account and train an xgboost to classify between CU-S and CU-D.
Seems to be a slight improvement.

transcript + BERT = about 65% acc
features + xgboost = about 60% acc
transcript + BERT + bottleneck = improvement
pause encoded transcript + BERT = ?
pause encoded transcript + BERT + bottleneck = ?
For each fold, do majority vote? (run n times)

need to look for more features that can separate AD and non-AD.
